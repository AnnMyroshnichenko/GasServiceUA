# GasServiceUA
GasServiceUA is a website created to help a local gas company manage its services for people in the community. The main idea behind this project is to make it easier for both the company and its customers to keep track of gas usage, payments, bills, and personal accounts ‚Äî all in one place and online. The system allows customers to register for an account where they can send in their gas meter readings each month, dowload payments and gas usage reports, and see their current balance. They can also pay their bills via PayPal. The project includes unit tests with xUnit and Moq.
